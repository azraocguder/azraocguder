    <h1>THE DARK KNİGHT</h1>
    <p>The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan and the second installment in The Dark
        Knight Trilogy. The movie follows Bruce Wayne, who fights crime in Gotham City as Batman.

        In this film, Batman teams up with Lieutenant James Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent to take down
        organized crime. However, their efforts are challenged by a new and dangerous criminal mastermind: The Joker.

        The Joker spreads chaos across Gotham, testing Batman’s morals and pushing the city to the edge of destruction.
        He targets people close to Batman and manipulates Harvey Dent into becoming the villain Two-Face.

        Batman ultimately takes the blame for crimes he didn’t commit in order to protect Dent’s reputation and maintain
        hope in Gotham. The film ends with Batman becoming a fugitive, choosing to be the "silent guardian" and "dark
        knight" the city needs.

        The movie is known for its deep themes of chaos vs. order, heroism, sacrifice, and moral complexity — and
        features an iconic performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker.</p>
