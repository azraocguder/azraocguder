    <h2><a href="the_godfather.html">The Godfather</a> </h2>

    <p>The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novel by Mario Puzo.
        The story follows the powerful Corleone crime family in post–World War II New York.

        The head of the family, Vito Corleone (the Godfather), is a respected and feared mafia boss. When he is nearly
        assassinated by rival criminals, his youngest son, Michael Corleone, who initially wanted nothing to do with the
        family business, is forced to step in to protect his father.

        As Michael gets more involved, he becomes deeply entangled in the world of organized crime. Over time, he
        transforms from a quiet outsider to a ruthless and strategic leader. After Vito's death, Michael becomes the new
        Godfather and eliminates all threats to the family, securing their power.

        The film explores themes of loyalty, power, family, betrayal, and the dark side of the American dream. It's
        considered one of the greatest and most influential films in cinematic history.</p>

    <h2><a href="the_dark_knight.html">The Dark Knight</a></h2>

    <p>The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan and the second installment in The Dark
        Knight Trilogy. The movie follows Bruce Wayne, who fights crime in Gotham City as Batman.

        In this film, Batman teams up with Lieutenant James Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent to take down
        organized crime. However, their efforts are challenged by a new and dangerous criminal mastermind: The Joker.

        The Joker spreads chaos across Gotham, testing Batman’s morals and pushing the city to the edge of destruction.
        He targets people close to Batman and manipulates Harvey Dent into becoming the villain Two-Face.

        Batman ultimately takes the blame for crimes he didn’t commit in order to protect Dent’s reputation and maintain
        hope in Gotham. The film ends with Batman becoming a fugitive, choosing to be the "silent guardian" and "dark
        knight" the city needs.

        The movie is known for its deep themes of chaos vs. order, heroism, sacrifice, and moral complexity — and
        features an iconic performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker.</p>
